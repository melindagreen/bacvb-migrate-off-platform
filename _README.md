WordPress is a blogging and lightweight CMS written in PHP.

This template builds WordPress on Platform.sh using the [`johnbolch/wordpress`](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) "Composer Fork" of WordPress.  All plugins and themes should be managed with Composer exclusively. Recommended starter plugins have been added to composer.json along with the default installation of our parent/child themes.
