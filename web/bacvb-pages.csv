Article-Subsection Powel Crosley, Jr. Industrialist. Inventor. Visionary. While Powel Crosley Jr. never made more than $50 a week before he was 30, by age 33 he had amassed a fortune selling auto parts through the then-unheard-of medium of direct mail. His son wanted a wireless radio, so he perfected and manufactured the first low-priced crystal set, the hugely successful ""Harko,"" opening that entertainment medium to the masses. He ventured into radio broadcasting to sell more radios and at 500,000 watts had the most powerful station in the world. His radio station – The Nation's Station, WLW – was the proving ground for the early careers of many who went on to global stardom. His television station became the first NBC affiliate, and Crosley's own Cincinnati Reds baseball team became the first sports program ever broadcast in color. In his lifetime, Powel Crosley Jr. used his fortune and his enterprise to assist many others up the ladder of success. His many charitable contributions provided a teaching environment for tens of thousands of young men and women. By the end of his life, he had invented, developed, manufactured or produced: The first compact economy car (1939) First auto radio (1930) Electric wagon (1900) Shelvador refrigerator 500,000-watt radio station (1934) Night baseball (1935) Soap operas (1934) Facsimile machine (1940) First 4-wheel disc brakes (1939) 35mm camera Airplanes (4 different) First radio broadcast from an airplane (1930) Phonographs, scalp massagers, canoes, furniture, baby carriages, washing machines, stoves and bed-cooling systems. In 2013, Powel Crosley, Jr. was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.Watch the video The History of the Powel Crosley Estate Powel Crosley built the Florida winter home for his wife, Gwendolyn, in 1929. The two-and-a-half-story Mediterranean mansion was built in the southwest corner of Bradenton on a 60-acre parcel of land on Sarasota Bay adjacent to the John Ringling Estate. The 11,000-square-foot home has 21 rooms and 10 baths, and an adjacent carriage house has room for three cars and servants' quarters on the second floor. Originally the mansion had a swimming pool, a seaplane dock and yacht basin. The home featured many innovations for its time, including a steel frame encased in cast stone, embedded pipes and wiring, and a 135-day construction schedule. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, Seagate was saved from commercial development and purchased for renovation by Manatee County, which operates it as a meeting, conference and event venue.

But despite its name, the Tour de Turtles isn’t for fame, glory and shiny gold medals, though. Its purpose is to encourage and support research, education and protection of the natural habitats upon which sea turtles depend. For this, the 10th year of the Tour de Turtles, the Waterline Marina Resort & Beach Club and Anna Maria Island Turtle Watch & Shorebird Monitoring (AMITW) have partnered to raise awareness of the harmful effects light pollution has on sea turtles’ nesting behavior. The Waterline and AMITW are sponsoring Eliza Ann, a female loggerhead turtle who recently laid her eggs on Anna Maria Island. On June 20, a crowd of Bradenton Area locals, visitors, and staff and volunteers from The Waterline and AMITW were on hand as Eliza Ann made her way back into the sea. For three months, visitors to tourdeturtles.com can follow Eliza Ann and her competitors as they travel among the currents. The turtle that travels the farthest over the three-month period will be announced as the winner of this year’s marathon. Even though we’re rooting for Eliza Ann to win, we’re happy that people are excited to support such an important cause.

Article-Subsection Highway to Sell New Series Premieres September 1 at 10PM ET/PT Every guy's ultimate four-wheel fantasy becomes his worst nightmare when he is forced to choose between the cash he desperately needs and the classic ride he always knew his clunker could become in Discovery Channel's all new series, HIGHWAY TO SELL premiering on September 1 at 10PM ET/PT. Across America, neglected classic cars are waiting to be restored and make their way back onto the street. Enter Dennis Pittsenbarger and ""Slick."" Over the years, automotive expert Pittsenbarger has made a name for himself in the car world. A walking encyclopedia of automotive history and design, Pittsenbarger is a long-time race car driver with a working knowledge of nearly every car make and model ever made. His partner in chrome, mechanical mastermind Slick, has retooled hundreds of cars in his 12,000 square ft. Florida shop, and created period-perfect movie cars for Hollywood Films. Rather than just buying broken down vehicles from their owners, the pair deals differently. Dennis, Slick and their team spend their own money and time working to restore the car to its former glory. However, once they are done, the car goes to auction where the owner has a difficult choice to make: take a cut of the profits, or buy their cherished ride back at a discounted rate. Will the owners choose to let go of their beloved classics and walk away with the cash, or will the thought of seeing their dream car in the hands of another be too much to handle? It's cash vs. classics in the all new series, HIGHWAY TO SELL. HIGHWAY TO SELL is produced for Discovery Channel by Twelve02 Television, where Jim Casey is executive producer. For Discovery Channel, Joseph Boyle is executive producer with Todd Lefkowitz as associate producer. http://press.discovery.com/us/dsc/programs/highway-sell/ The Take a tour of the set of Dry Creek with Bay News 9 Horses, cowboys, Indians and the thrill of old Florida comes together on the set of Dry Creek.

Fourteen major movies were filmed in Florida in 2012. Some of the most noticeable titles include ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Spring Breakers.""Local TV and film makers are also making a mark in Florida. Les McDowell is filming his cable/internet series called “Dry Creek” on his property. His land in Parrish looks like a country town from the late 1800’s. The town is equipped with staples like a saloon, general store and church.“It’s pretty much a replica of what old Florida would really be like way before Disney. It’s a lot like Little House on the Prairie, you take the Waltons and you take Mayberry and you mix them all up in a pot and that’s Dry Creek,” said McDowell.McDowell created the fictional town after being laid off from his job in 2009.“I got to the point where I wanted to reinvent myself,” said McDowell.Hundreds of local actors and crew members help make Dry Creek a reality.Check out the 1800's town here on The List Sho An independent film maker is also utilizing Dry Creek, but for something a little different. Christian Schwier and his crew at Litewave Media are making the Sci-Fi film “The Skyship Chronicles.” Part of the movie is being filmed in Parrish.“We’ve got a story about a young girl who has escaped from an evil villain inventor, and then we fast-forward to the future,” said Schwier.The movie should be available for the public in April.",,2017-09-29 16:02:21,2018-10-02 11:02:49,1

We thought we knew everything there was to know about the museum after making several visits over the years. That was until recently when we sat down with the museum’s Communications Director, Jessica Schubick, and their Provost, Jeff Rodgers. During our interview, we learned that there is so much more to this long-standing museum than meets the eye. Attachment: 20180425114604-Img-Ss0192.png So much so, that when prompted with ‘how are we ever going to fit all of this into one story’, both Jessica and Jeff responded “you can’t.” With that in mind, where does one even begin to explain everything the South Florida Museum has to offer? “The South Florida Museum is a natural history and cultural history museum focused on Florida,” Jessica offered. That sounded simple enough, but then she continued, “The museum tells the story of earth, life, and beyond through Florida as a microcosm,” instantly expanding our understanding of the museum’s offerings ten-fold. The museum includes the main natural history exhibit, along with the Bishop Planetarium and the Parker Manatee Rehabilitation Aquarium, which is a second-stage stage center where injured or orphaned manatees are cared for before they are released back into the wild. But the South Florida Museum isn’t just a small place for artifacts - it’s a staple of the Bradenton Area community. Originally located on the Memorial Pier, the museum has been part of Bradenton’s history since 1946. 20180425114604-img-ss0192.png Attachment: 20180425114841-Img-0201.png “Our founding collection, which can still be found in the museum, was the collection of Florida-based amateur archaeologist Montague Tallant,” Jessica told us. Despite his career as a furniture store owner, Tallant ended up saving much of Florida’s history through his hobby. When the Smithsonian Institute expressed interest in his vast collection, local leaders came together to acquire nearly half of his artifacts in an effort to preserve their area’s history. 20180425114841-img-0201.png Attachment: 20180425115203-Bishopstars-Sk2Zch1Wzvekdvttz50Bcis18Q0Ablzbh-Rgb-L.jpeg The museum later expanded and was moved to its current location in 1966. The move to a larger location also included the addition of the Bishop Planetarium. “It was bigger than any planetarium you’d expect to see in a community of our size,” Jeff said. “And it was state-of-the-art when it was built. The community thinking was well ahead of its time.” After a fire in 2001, the planetarium was completely rebuilt and re-opened four years later. “Again, forward thinking,” Jeff noted. He explained that they again adopted state-of-the-art technology and become one of the first planetariums to use digital technology, which they continue to update as technology grows today. That includes a 3D digital map of the entire observable universe. 20180425115203-bishopstars-sk2zch1wzvekdvttz50bcis18q0ablzbh-rgb-l.jpeg Article-Subsection One of Jeff’s favorite planetarium presentations is a 19-minute show narrated by Tom Hanks called Passport to the Universe. The show takes you from Earth to the furthest edges of the known universe. “Invariably, people walk out with a different respect for their place in the universe,” Jeff said. “The word I hear most often is ‘insignificant’.” Attachment: 20180425115951-Img-0216.png A fan favorite section of the museum is undeniably the Parker Manatee Aquarium. In 1993, the museum became a founding member of the Manatee Rehabilitation Partnership and got their first rehab manatee in 1998. “We’ve cared for 36 manatees during our time in the partnership,” Jessica explained. “That’s really something we’re proud of – we really take in these manatees that were injured, or sick, or abandoned and then we care for them until they’re ready to be released back into the wild.” 20180425115951-img-0216.png Attachment: 20180425120441-Img-0247.png Often you’ll see visitors watching the manatees for long periods of time. “I think people like seeing their individual personalities,” Jessica said. “With the three we have right now, I’ve found that they’re curious about different things. It’s fun for visitors to see that they’re not just blobs in the water.” With all their knowledge and time spent in the museum, it's easy to forget that Jessica and Jeff are just regular Bradenton area locals. In their free time, Jessica enjoys the local craft breweries and Jeff spends his time in the many nature preserves. Both are foodies, and love how the local culinary scene is blossoming. 20180425120441-img-0247.png Article-Subsection Both Jessica and Jeff wants locals and visitors alike to understand that the South Florida Museum is constantly growing and evolving. “We’re not a dusty little hometown museum,” Jeff expressed. “There’s always something going on.” That includes their events, upcoming exhibits, and expansions, like their upcoming Mosiac Backyard Universe. “Stop by any day and I guarantee you’ll be surprised by something you encounter,” Jessica concluded.

There are plenty of places to watch the sun drop, whether it be sitting on the powder-soft sand of Anna Maria Island or dining riverside in downtown Bradenton.

121,contest,1,Adrenaline Row,adrenaline-row,,Adrenaline Row,,,"Adrenaline Row Adrenaline Row Attachment Article-Subsection Celebrating Excitement Bradenton, Florida’s Adrenaline Row turns an anniversary into an adventure By Kelli Hann There’s nothing like moving to put a spotlight on how much stuff you have. Standing in the garage, staring at nearly a dozen boxes headed to charity, my husband, Rob, said, “We have to stop the madness.” From that moment on, all our gifts to each other have been “experience” gifts. Exotic restaurants, snorkeling, weekend getaways, beach days. Fun and adventure over things. So, when our wedding anniversary came up, we opted for an action-packed weekend of water sports. We wanted to pack in tons of activities without spending all weekend driving. With a quick web search, Rob discovered Adrenaline Row in Bradenton. Adrenaline Row is a mile-long strip of land that goes from Bradenton across Palma Sola Bay to Anna Maria Island. There’s a lot to do there: horseback riding (or surfing), the beach, jet skiing, kayaking, fishing, flyboarding…we had trouble choosing! Finally, after much discussion (and a snarky QuizUp battle to see who got to pick the hotel) I went online and reserved kayaks, jet skis, a horseback riding tour, and a flyboarding lesson. Our adrenaline-fueled anniversary in the Bradenton area was on! Do More Outdoors in Bradenton ➤ Share this Kayaking dream come true We arrived at our hotel Friday night, so we’d be ready to roll in the morning. After breakfast, we headed to The Surfer Bus. It’s an actual bus—vintage-beachy-surfer-cool, with SUPs strapped on top and paddles in blue, red and yellow leaning in a row against the wood-paneled side—we had just rolled into a 1960s surfer movie. The Surfer Bus is loaded with fun “C’mon Kelli, stop Instagramming and let’s go!” Rob insisted. Rob helped me launch my kayak into the calm water of the bay then eased in beside me. We chose the self-guided Robinson Preserve Tower Route. After crossing a short stretch of open water, we glided into a narrow passage with mangroves on either side that arched over us to form a tunnel. It was magical—all I could hear was the soft waves of the water against the mangrove roots and the occasional splash of Rob’s paddle. Light filtered through the canopy, making dots of sunlight dance like fairies. As soon as the path widened, I signaled Rob to go ahead of me so he could go through the next mangrove tunnel first. Make playful friends About halfway through the trip we were crossing a wide area together when suddenly Rob whispered, “Kelli, dolphins!” He was pointing just in front of us to the left. A few seconds later I heard a light huff then saw a fin rise out of the water, arching up then sliding back under without so much as a ripple. It was followed by another fin, another huff—two dolphins. I’d never seen dolphins in the wild and was shaking with excitement. Rob’s eyes were as big as plates and we were both grinning like fools. We got to see them surface six times before we turned back. Bucket list: kayak with dolphins. Check. Kayak with the dolphins in Bradenton ➤ Share this Two kinds of rides Wave from the waves Our next stop was across the street for jet skiing. We had no sooner hopped on when Rob shot off like a bullet. I punched it to keep up, leaning into the wind. Jet skiing always makes me giddy. It’s that same feeling you get when you run down a hill so fast your legs aren’t quite keeping up—that buzz you get when you’re part flying and part falling and completely free. “Watch this!” Rob called as he did a circle around me. Watch? Oh, no, not today. DO. The rest of the hour was spent trying to one-up each other, until Rob won the day with a daredevil move where he spun around to create waves, then revved the clutch to “hop” over them. I tried it, but only managed to drench myself. Even then, it was so much fun I didn’t want to head back in. But we had plans for dinner and a movie, so I hollered, “Last one back is the designated driver!” My cocktails were delicious. Water horse—not to be confused with a seahorse The next day we found ourselves back on Adrenaline Row, this time at BeachHorses™ to try HorseSurfing™. After getting to know our horses and trainers, our group of 12 rode in a jagged line along the beach. The day was hot, but the sun made both water and sand sparkle and I felt a wave of contentment. Soon we turned the horses and headed into the bay. As the cool water washed over my legs and up to my waist, I let it lift me slightly, gliding and floating at the same time, weightless. Once the horses were swimming (they swam surprisingly fast), the trainers showed us how to surf. It looked easy. When it was my turn to try, I got my legs under me in a frog crouch, planted my feet, slowly rose up, and SPLASH! After many tries, I finally got the rhythm of the horse’s swimming motion and managed to stay standing. “Take a picture, take a picture!” I yelled at Rob. Luckily, he was already on it—he’d been GoPro filming my wipeouts the whole time. When I was done, he handed me the camera and had his own clumsy go at it. That video is better than any anniversary present money could buy. Experience horse surfing in Bradenton ➤ Share this High intensity thrills Trade the high rise for a high ride! We closed out our trip with a flyboarding lesson at TOP GUN Flyboards. After a short how-to (and how not to) briefing, Rob rode out with our guide/guru, Jonathan. They got into position. There was a suspenseful moment of quiet then the jet ski that supplies the water propulsion to the flyboard rumbled to life. Slowly Rob rose out of the water. He got about a foot up before he fell backward, but he was soon up again. After about 15 minutes of short lifts and big falls, he seemed to get the hang of it and managed a few wobbly spins. Watching Rob have all that fun had me psyched to try it. As soon as the jet ski revved up and I started to lift out of the water, I knew I was hard-core hooked. There was nothing holding me down or back. No resistance of equipment or gravity. I was floating, flying—I was a superhero. Rising out of the water, hovering in the air with my arms hanging loose by my sides. Fly like a superhero in Bradenton ➤ Share this Adrenaline Row junkies “How soon can we come back?” I asked as we headed home. “Well, my birthday is coming up.” “The clerk at the hotel lobby told me the Palma Sola Causeway Park right there on Adrenaline Row rented pavilions with grills and tables. We could invite Jenna and Chris, have easy access to all the Adrenaline Row stuff, and then have a cookout.” “Sounds perfect. Let’s do it.” Looks like Adrenaline Row is a gift that’s going to keep on giving. Discover more exciting things to do outdoors in Bradenton, Florida.

We Take Sustainability Seriously You may have strolled the charming shops of Pine Avenue on Anna Maria Island, but did you know that it’s considered the “Greenest Little Main Street in America”? The candy colored buildings lining this road may make it look like a regular beach town, but they are actually all platinum LEED-certified and solar powered! Along with the native Florida plants, community gardens, and crushed shell sidewalks, Pine Avenue is a true modern marvel when it comes to sustainability. Some other eco-friendly places to visit when you’re in the Bradenton Area are Bunker Hill Winery, which uses only recycled wine bottles and real cork along with a solar powered irrigation system, and the U-Pick area at O’Brien Family Farms that boasts dozens of types of hydroponically grown fresh fruits and veggies. 20180627155929-frame-template-polaroids.png Attachment: 20180627160838-Frame-Template-M-Shell.png 3.

Your Pittsburgh Pirates made Bradenton their southern home since 1969 and are a huge part of the Bradenton Area’s community. The best part? You’ll get to experience some history of America’s pastime because LECOM Park (formerly McKechnie Field) is the old operating Spring Training facility in professional baseball, and the third oldest ballpark used in major league baseball (behind just Fenway and Wrigley)! Even if you’ve been to the Bradenton Area before, there are probably some things that you didn’t know that will make you love your vacation spot even more. For instance – did you know that Bradenton is the official sister city of Pittsburgh? Yes, in 2011 the two cities formed a two city alliance in an effort to show their loyalty to one another. How did they do that? Over a game of baseball, naturally. 20180806095422-s.png Attachment: 20180806093410-Frame-Template-Orange.png Feeling homesick? No worries, Fanatics Sports Bar & Grill in Bradenton has you covered. Here you’ll find like-minded individuals who just want to sit down with a Yuengling and a burger and catch the Steelers game. Just be sure to arrive early – this place fills up with gold and black jerseys fast! And while you won’t want to miss a single rousing ball game, you might want to add some extra time to your trip to the Bradenton Area. No trip is complete without spending hours on our pristine beaches, but there’s more that we think you might like. For instance – try meeting the rehab manatees at the South Florida Museum’s Manatee Aquarium. Or grab a cocktail while listening to live music on historic Bridge Street on Anna Maria Island. Even better, tour an authentic Florida orange grove at Mixon Fruit Farms, and send your family back a beautiful basket of gift fruit. 20180806093410-frame-template-orange.png Attachment: 20180806094338-Frame-Ss.png Yes, dear Yinzer, you’ve come to the right place to start planning your Bradenton Area vacation. We think you’ll love the variety of accommodations options – from historic hotels near the ballpark to luxurious private homes on the island, you’ll surely find the perfect place to stay. Be sure to check out everything the destination has to offer and of course, go Bucs! 20180806094338-frame-ss.png",,2018-08-06 09:16:41,2018-10-02 11:02:54,1
