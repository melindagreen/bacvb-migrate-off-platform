The Natchez Indians inhabited what is now southwest Mississippi ca. 700-1730 AD, with the culture at its zenith in the mid-1500s. Between 1682 and 1729 the Grand Village was their main ceremonial center, according to historical and archaeological evidence. French explorers, priests and journalists descriptions of the ceremonial mounds and archaeological investigations produced additional evidence that the site was the place that the French called ""the Grand Village of the Natchez Indians."" 

During the period that the Natchez occupied the Grand Village, the French explored the region and began to make settlements. Relations between the French and the Natchez were cordial at first, but deteriorated as various disagreements and episodes of violence arose in 1716 and again in 1723. In 1729, a pro-English element within the tribe led the Natchez to attack the French colonial plantations and military garrison at Fort Rosalie. The French retaliated in such force that the Natchez were forced to abandon their homeland.

Johnson's diary evolved into an extraordinary record of social, economic, and political life in his hometown of Natchez, Mississippi, as seen through the eyes of a free man of color.

He acquired several building in Natchez, approximately 2,000 acres of land south of town and he owned several slaves. He gained the respect of leading citizens of the time, some of whom he loaned money to, and local papers eulogized him after his untimely death.

William Johnson kept a diary for almost sixteen years, from 1835 until his death in 1851. It is the lengthiest and most detailed personal narrative authored by an African American during the antebellum era in the United States.

Johnson's diary evolved into an extraordinary record of social, economic, and political life in his hometown of Natchez, Mississippi, as seen through the eyes of a free man of color. Johnson covers everything from the mundane like Johnson's search for a lost cow to the momentous such as former president Andrew Jackson's visit to Natchez.
