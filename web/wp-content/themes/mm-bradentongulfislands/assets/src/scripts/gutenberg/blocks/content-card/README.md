# Content Card

This is a customizable card block that can be used to display any type of content.

## Card Styles
Each card style should be added in a separate stylesheet in the styles folder.

## Content Types
By default this block uses post, page, or custom, but this can be extended to use any post type simply by adding it to the list in wizard.js

## Using with Slider
If using the "slider" block in automatic or manual post mode, this block including content options and styles will be imported there.
