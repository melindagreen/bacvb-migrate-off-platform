# Kraken ACF Connector

This block outputs ACF data using core block supports for colors, spacing, and typography

- Primarily intended for single listing and single event templates
- Support for all default Kraken Event and Kraken CRM fields
- Date & time formatting uses the Kraken Events utility functions for consistency but may be modified however needed
- Support for custom fields by selecting "custom" and entering the field name. The block will check the field type and apply appropriate formatting (work in progress)

## Why not block bindings?

Because the WordPress visual interface does not support this yet and must be added via code editor
