- Official documentation can be found here https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/filters/block-filters/
- There is also a wiki page here detailing individual file functionality https://wiki.maddenmedia.com/Gutenberg_Block_Filters
- The theme-customization.js will output dynamic attributes that can be defined in theme-kraken.json in the theme folder.
- Files in /presets/ contain common filters used across our websites and be enabled/disabled in the plugin settings.
